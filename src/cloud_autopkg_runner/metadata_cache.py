"""Module for managing the metadata cache used by cloud-autopkg-runner.

This module provides functions for loading, storing, and updating
cached metadata related to AutoPkg recipes. The cache helps improve
performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from external
sources.

The metadata cache is stored in a JSON file and contains information
about downloaded files, such as their size, ETag, and last modified date.
This information is used to create dummy files for testing purposes and
to avoid unnecessary downloads.
